SIR models

This model includes the closed population Suceptible - Infectious - Recovered without vital data, to describe 
epidemic diseases lifetime.

In this program, the inputs are:

* the number of days that the disease will be evaluated, 
* the rate at which it is transmitted
* the number of initial suceptible population.
* number of days that the disease is infectious (appearance of symptoms until the host is recovered)
* initial  number of Infectious 
* initial number of Recovered cases.

The model should display the number of Suceptible, Infectious and Recovered persons in the population described at the end of the period evaluated, aswell as a graph showing curves for each of these.

The basic reproductive number is displayed too, which is the number of people that are infected with the disease for every person infected by it.
