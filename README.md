SIR and Exponential Growth deterministic models

This model includes the closed population Suceptible - Infectious - Recovered without vital data, to describe 
epidemic diseases lifetime.

It also includes the Exponential Growth rate in case there is no information available to do a SIR model.

In this program, it has to be included the number of days that the disease will be evaluated, the rate at which it is 
transmitted and the number of initial suceptible population.

In the case of the SIR model, it is also required to know the number of days that the disease is infectious (appearance of
symptoms until the host is recovered), as well the initial values for number of Infectious and number of Recovered cases.

The model should display a graph showing three curves (in case of SIR model) and one curve in case of the Exponential Growth.
In case the SIR model is selected, it also will show the base reproductive number, which is the number of people that are
infected with the disease for every person infected by it.
